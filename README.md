The Library Management System is a console-based C++ application that helps manage library operations like adding, removing, issuing, and returning books. 
It uses object-oriented programming to keep the code modular and efficient.  
Users can also search for books by title or author. 
This project provides a simple and effective way to organize a library's book inventory.
